.SYNOPSIS
    Intune Proactive Remediation (Detection Only) - Triggers Intune sync and logs scheduled workload times.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script restarts the Intune Management Extension service to reset delay timers,
    triggers an immediate sync, and logs the scheduled processing times for each workload
    to a local log file.

.NOTES
    Deploy as a Proactive Remediation using DETECTION SCRIPT ONLY (no remediation script).
    The script performs all actions during the detection phase and always exits with code 0.

    Run as: System
    Run in 64-bit PowerShell: Yes
